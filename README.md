# WDI CO2 analysis
For my independent Milestone project, I was tasked to explore and analyze WDI datasets of my choice. I decided to explore a CO2 dataset, in which
I would explore CO2 outputs by countries, regions, and groups of countries by how developed the county is. In addition, I looked into the correlation
between CO2 output and Forest Area. Please take a look at the notebook for more detail.

# Data
WDI: World Development Indicators

Country, CO2, and Forest Area data was taken from WDI.

CO2 is measured in kilotons.
Forest Area is measured in kilometers.

# Altair Visualizations
Due to trouble in displaying altair visualizations through git notebooks, I have saved the png files of the visualization in the altair_vis_pngs folder.
Please view in order as you read the notebook.
